# Time Series Forecasting using XGBoost

This project builds a time series forecasting model to predict hourly energy consumption using the PJME dataset. It leverages XGBoost's power for regression on engineered time-based features.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Highlights
- Time-indexed feature engineering (hour, day, week, etc.)
- Visual data exploration and seasonal patterns
- XGBoost model training with early stopping
- Performance evaluated using RMSE and error analysis

## Results
Achieved robust short-term forecasts of energy consumption with visual and quantitative validation.

## How to Run
